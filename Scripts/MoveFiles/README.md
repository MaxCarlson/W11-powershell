# MoveFiles

## Overview
The `MoveFiles` directory contains scripts and utilities for organizing and managing the output files generated by the simulations. These scripts help in moving and categorizing files based on their status (solved, unsolvable, timed-out) to ensure that the data is well-organized and easily accessible for further analysis.

## Scripts

### move_solved.sh
This script moves files that have been marked as solved to the designated folder.

**Usage:**
```sh
./move_solved.sh <source_directory> <destination_directory>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<source_directory>`: The directory containing the files to be moved.
- `<destination_directory>`: The directory where the solved files will be moved to.

### move_unsolvable.sh
This script moves files that have been marked as unsolvable to the designated folder.

**Usage:**
```sh
./move_unsolvable.sh <source_directory> <destination_directory>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<source_directory>`: The directory containing the files to be moved.
- `<destination_directory>`: The directory where the unsolvable files will be moved to.

### move_timed_out.sh
This script moves files that have timed out to the designated folder.

**Usage:**
```sh
./move_timed_out.sh <source_directory> <destination_directory>
```

**Parameters:**
- `<source_directory>`: The directory containing the files to be moved.
- `<destination_directory>`: The directory where the timed-out files will be moved to.

## Usage
To use any of the scripts, navigate to the `MoveFiles` directory and execute the desired script with the appropriate parameters.

Example:
```sh
cd Scripts/MoveFiles
./move_solved.sh /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

## Installation
1. Ensure that the scripts have executable permissions:
   ```sh
   chmod +x move_solved.sh
   chmod +x move_unsolvable.sh
   chmod +x move_timed_out.sh
   ```

2. Run the scripts as needed to organize your simulation output files.
